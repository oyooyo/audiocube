# audiocube

Software toolbox for a few similar devices I call "audio cubes":  More or less, cube-shaped audio players with an integrated speaker, that will automatically start playing fairytales from their internal memory when one of the affiliated figures (containing a hidden NFC tag), is placed on top of the device.
